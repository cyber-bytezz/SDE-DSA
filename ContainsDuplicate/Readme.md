### **Understanding the Problem**
- **Goal:** Check if the list `nums` contains duplicate values.
- **Input:** A list of integers `nums`.
- **Output:** `True` if there is any duplicate, otherwise `False`.

---

### **Step-by-Step Explanation of the Code**
#### **Class Definition**
```python
class Solution:
```
- `class` → This is used to define a **class** in Python.
- `Solution` → The name of the class. In LeetCode, solutions are usually written inside a class.

---

#### **Method Definition**
```python
    def containDuplicate(self, nums: list[int]) -> bool:
```
- `def` → This is a **function definition** keyword in Python.
- `containDuplicate` → This is the **function name**, but **notice the typo**. It should be **`containsDuplicate`** (with "s") because it's checking multiple values.
- `self` → This refers to the instance of the class. It is required when defining methods inside a class.
- `nums: list[int]` → This is a **parameter** that takes a list of integers (`nums`).
- `-> bool` → This is a **return type annotation**, meaning the function should return a boolean (`True` or `False`).

✅ **Correction:** The correct function name should be:
```python
def containsDuplicate(self, nums: list[int]) -> bool:
```
---

#### **Step 1: Creating an Empty Set**
```python
        # Creating the empty list name Hashset and use the set() <- this will find the Duplicate Value
        hashset = set()
```
- `hashset = set()` → This **creates an empty set** called `hashset`.
- **Why a set?**  
  - A **set** is a data structure that **only stores unique values**.
  - Using a set allows us to check for duplicates efficiently.
  - **Checking if an element exists in a set takes O(1) time (average case).**

---

#### **Step 2: Looping Through the List**
```python
        # In this we are Mentioning For for Loop in nums
        for n in nums:
```
- `for n in nums:` → This is a **loop** that goes through each element `n` in the `nums` list.
- **Purpose:** This helps us check each number one by one.

---

#### **Step 3: Checking for Duplicates**
```python
            # if the nums in the hashset it will return True
            if nums in hashset:
                return True
```
✅ **Error in Code:**  
- `if nums in hashset:` is **wrong**.  
- It should be `if n in hashset:` because `n` represents each element in the loop.  
- **Explanation:**
  - `if n in hashset:` → This checks if the number `n` is already present in the set.
  - **If `n` is found in `hashset`**, it means this number has appeared before, so we **return `True`** (there is a duplicate).

✅ **Corrected Code:**
```python
if n in hashset:
    return True
```

---

#### **Step 4: Adding Number to the Set**
```python
            # In this we are adding the nums and Return false
            hashset.add(nums)
```
✅ **Error in Code:**  
- `hashset.add(nums)` is **wrong** because `nums` is the whole list.
- It should be `hashset.add(n)`, as `n` is the number being checked.

✅ **Corrected Code:**
```python
hashset.add(n)
```
- `hashset.add(n)` → This **adds** the number `n` to the set so that we remember it was seen before.

---

#### **Step 5: Returning `False` (No Duplicates Found)**
```python
        return False
```
- If the loop finishes without returning `True`, it means there were **no duplicates** in `nums`, so we **return `False`**.

---

### **Final Corrected Code with Explanations**
```python
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: list[int]) -> bool:
        """
        Function to check if a list contains duplicate values.
        Returns True if there is a duplicate, otherwise False.
        """

        # Step 1: Create an empty set to store unique numbers
        hashset = set()  # Set is used because lookup operations are O(1)

        # Step 2: Iterate over each number in the list
        for n in nums:
            # Step 3: If the number is already in the set, return True (duplicate found)
            if n in hashset:
                return True  # Exit function immediately since we found a duplicate
            
            # Step 4: Otherwise, add the number to the set (mark as seen)
            hashset.add(n)

        # Step 5: If no duplicates are found, return False
        return False
```

### **How to Think About the Code?**
- **Step 1:** Choose a data structure (`set`) that allows fast duplicate checks.
- **Step 2:** Loop through each number in the array.
- **Step 3:** If the number is already in the set, return `True` (found a duplicate).
- **Step 4:** If the number is new, add it to the set.
- **Step 5:** If no duplicates are found after checking all numbers, return `False`.

✅ **Time Complexity:** **O(n)** → Each number is checked once and added to a set once.  
✅ **Space Complexity:** **O(n)** → In the worst case, we store all `n` elements in the set.

### **Alternative Approaches**
#### **1. Sorting Approach (Slower)**
```python
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: list[int]) -> bool:
        nums.sort()  # Sorts the list first (O(n log n))
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):  # Iterate through the list
            if nums[i] == nums[i + 1]:  # If two consecutive numbers are the same, return True
                return True
        return False
```
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) (due to sorting)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) (if sorting in place)

---

#### **2. Using Set Directly (Shortest Code)**
```python
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: list[int]) -> bool:
        return len(nums) != len(set(nums))
```
- **How does this work?**
  - `set(nums)` removes all duplicates.
  - If the length of `set(nums)` is **smaller** than `len(nums)`, that means duplicates were removed → Return `True`.
  - Otherwise, return `False`.

✔ **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
✔ **Space Complexity:** O(n)

### **Final Summary**
| Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | When to Use? |
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Set Approach** | O(n) | O(n) | Best for large datasets |
| **Sorting Approach** | O(n log n) | O(1) | When modifying input is allowed |
| **Set Length Check** | O(n) | O(n) | Shortest, Pythonic way |

✅ **Recommended Solution:** **Use the set-based approach (`O(n)`).**
