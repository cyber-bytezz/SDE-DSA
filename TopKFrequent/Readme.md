## **🧵 The Story of "Finding the Most Popular Items"**
Imagine you are running a **voting contest** where people vote for their **favorite movies**. Your job is to **find the top `k` most popular movies**.

### **🔹 Step 1: Count How Many Votes Each Movie Got**
📌 **What we need to do?**  
- Before we figure out the most popular movies, we need to **count how many votes** each movie got.
- We'll use a **dictionary** to store this count.

```python
count = {}  # Dictionary to store frequency of each number
for num in nums:
    count[num] = 1 + count.get(num, 0)  # Increase count of the number
```
💡 **How does this work?**  
- We loop through each movie in `nums` (our list of votes).
- If the movie is **already in our dictionary**, we **increase its vote count**.
- If the movie is **not in our dictionary**, we start its count at `0` and then add `1`.

### **🔹 Step 2: Create "Buckets" to Group Movies by Popularity**
📌 **What we need to do?**  
- We now know how many votes each movie got.
- We need a **way to quickly find** the most popular movies.
- We use a **Bucket Sort-like approach** where we **group movies by how many votes they got**.

```python
freq = [[] for i in range(len(nums) + 1)]  # Create empty buckets
```
💡 **How does this work?**  
- We create a list of **empty lists** (buckets).
- The index of each bucket represents **how many times a movie was voted**.
- If a movie got **3 votes**, we put it in `freq[3]`.  
- If a movie got **2 votes**, we put it in `freq[2]`.

---

### **🔹 Step 3: Place Movies in Their Buckets**
📌 **What we need to do?**  
- Now that we have a **list of empty buckets**, let's **place each movie into its respective bucket**.

```python
for num, cnt in count.items():
    freq[cnt].append(num)  # Put the number in its frequency index
```
💡 **How does this work?**  
- We go through our **count dictionary** (`count.items()` gives us `(movie, votes)` pairs).
- We take each **movie** and place it in the `freq` list at the index equal to **its vote count**.

✅ **Example:**  
If `count = {1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1}`, we get:
```python
freq = [[], [3], [2], [1], [], []]
```
- `freq[3] = [1]` → Movie `1` got **3 votes**.
- `freq[2] = [2]` → Movie `2` got **2 votes**.
- `freq[1] = [3]` → Movie `3` got **1 vote**.

---

### **🔹 Step 4: Get the Top `k` Most Popular Movies**
📌 **What we need to do?**  
- Start from the **highest frequency bucket** and **pick movies** until we have `k` movies.

```python
res = []
for i in range(len(freq) - 1, 0, -1):  # Start from highest frequency
    for num in freq[i]:
        res.append(num)
        if len(res) == k:  # Stop when we have k elements
            return res
```
💡 **How does this work?**  
- We start from **the highest index** in `freq` (most votes).
- We **pick movies from the highest bucket first**.
- We add movies to our **result list** (`res`) **until we have `k` movies**.
- As soon as we have `k` movies, we **return the result**.

### **🔹 Example Walkthrough**
Let's say we are given this input:
```python
nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]  # People voted for these movies
k = 2  # We need the top 2 most popular movies
```

#### **Step 1: Count Frequency**
```python
count = {1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1}
```

#### **Step 2: Create Buckets**
```python
freq = [[], [3], [2], [1], [], []]
```

#### **Step 3: Extract the Top 2 Frequent Elements**
- Start from the **highest bucket (`freq[3]`)** → Pick `[1]`
- Next bucket (`freq[2]`) → Pick `[2]`
- Now we have `k = 2` elements: **`[1, 2]`** ✅

## **🧠 How to Think Logically in DSA?**
### **1️⃣ Ask: What are we solving?**
- We need to find the **top `k` most frequent numbers**.

### **2️⃣ Think: What is the best way to count frequency?**
- A dictionary (`{}`) is the best way to store **how many times each number appears**.

### **3️⃣ Consider: How can we retrieve the most frequent numbers efficiently?**
- Instead of sorting (which is slow), we **use buckets** to group numbers by frequency.
- This helps us **quickly pick the top `k` elements**.

### **4️⃣ Plan the steps before coding**
- **Step 1:** Count occurrences (`dictionary`).
- **Step 2:** Create frequency buckets (`list of lists`).
- **Step 3:** Group numbers by their count (`loop through dictionary`).
- **Step 4:** Start from the highest count and pick `k` numbers.

## **🚀 Final Code with Meaningful Names**
```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, numbers: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        # Step 1: Count frequency of each number
        frequency_map = {}  # Dictionary to store count of each number
        for num in numbers:
            frequency_map[num] = 1 + frequency_map.get(num, 0)
        
        # Step 2: Create frequency buckets
        buckets = [[] for _ in range(len(numbers) + 1)]
        
        # Step 3: Place numbers into their frequency buckets
        for num, count in frequency_map.items():
            buckets[count].append(num)
        
        # Step 4: Extract the top k frequent numbers
        top_k_frequent = []
        for frequency in range(len(buckets) - 1, 0, -1):
            for num in buckets[frequency]:
                top_k_frequent.append(num)
                if len(top_k_frequent) == k:
                    return top_k_frequent
```
