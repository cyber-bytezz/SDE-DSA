## **1. Understanding the Problem**

Imagine you have a grid (or table) of numbers. The rule is:  
- If any number in the grid is 0, then the entire row (horizontal line) and the entire column (vertical line) that contain that 0 must be changed to 0.

For example, if you have this grid:
```
1  1  1
1  0  1
1  1  1
```
The 0 is in the middle, so you need to change all numbers in the middle row and the middle column to 0:
```
1  0  1
0  0  0
1  0  1
```

**Why is this problem interesting?**  
It tests your ability to:
- Traverse a grid.
- Remember information without using extra space.
- Change the grid in place, meaning you modify the grid directly rather than making a copy.

## **2. Detailed Code Explanation**

### **2.1 Importing List for Type Hinting**

```python
from typing import List
```
- **What it does:**  
  This line tells Python that we will use a type called `List` later on.  
- **Why we do it:**  
  It makes our code clearer for people reading it (and some editors will give you hints), but it does not affect how the code runs.

---

### **2.2 Defining the Class and Function**

```python
class Solution:
    def setZeroes(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
```
- **What it does:**  
  - We create a **class** called `Solution` to group our functions.  
  - Inside the class, we define a function called `setZeroes` that takes one parameter called `matrix`, which is a list of lists of integers.
- **Why we do it:**  
  - Classes help organize code, especially when you have multiple functions or methods.  
  - The function’s purpose is to modify the `matrix` directly (in place) without returning anything.  
- **Key Concept:**  
  *"In-place"* means we change the original data structure instead of creating a new one.

---

### **2.3 Determining the Matrix Size**

```python
ROWS, COLS = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
```
- **What it does:**  
  - `len(matrix)` calculates how many rows the matrix has.
  - `len(matrix[0])` calculates how many columns the matrix has (we assume the matrix is not empty).
- **Example:**  
  For the matrix:
  ```
  [
    [1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1]
  ]
  ```
  - `ROWS` becomes 3 (since there are 3 rows).
  - `COLS` becomes 3 (since each row has 3 elements).
- **Why we do it:**  
  We need these values to know how far to loop when checking every cell.

---

### **2.4 Setting Up a Flag for the First Row**

```python
rowZero = False
```
- **What it does:**  
  It creates a variable named `rowZero` and sets it to `False`.
- **Why we do it:**  
  We use this flag to remember whether the **first row** needs to be set to 0.  
  - If any number in the first row is 0, we will later need to change the whole first row to 0.
- **Analogy:**  
  Think of `rowZero` as a reminder note you put on your desk. Initially, you assume no note is needed (False), but if you find a 0 in the first row, you stick a note on your desk (set it to True).

---

### **2.5 Scanning the Matrix and Marking Rows/Columns**

```python
for r in range(ROWS):
    for c in range(COLS):
        if matrix[r][c] == 0:
```
- **What it does:**  
  - The outer loop (`for r in range(ROWS)`) goes through each row.
  - The inner loop (`for c in range(COLS)`) goes through each column in that row.
  - The `if` statement checks: “Is the current cell equal to 0?”
- **Example:**  
  When `r = 1` and `c = 1` (the middle cell in our example), the condition `matrix[1][1] == 0` is true.
- **Why we do it:**  
  We need to check every number in the grid. If we find a 0, we will mark its row and column for later processing.

---

#### **2.5.1 Marking the Column**

```python
matrix[0][c] = 0  # Mark first row for this column
```
- **What it does:**  
  It sets the value in the first row of the current column (`c`) to 0.
- **Example:**  
  For `c = 1` (where the 0 was found), we change the first row’s element in column 1 to 0:
  ```
  Before marking:
  [1, 1, 1]  → becomes → [1, 0, 1]
  ```
- **Why we do it:**  
  We use the first row as a “marker” for columns.  
  This tells us later: “Column 1 should be all zeros because we marked it.”

---

#### **2.5.2 Marking the Row or Setting the Flag**

```python
if r > 0:
    matrix[r][0] = 0  # Mark first column for this row
else:
    rowZero = True  # Mark first row for zeroing later
```
- **What it does:**  
  - If the zero is found in any row **other than the first row** (`r > 0`), we mark the first column of that row by setting `matrix[r][0]` to 0.
  - If the zero is in the **first row** (`r == 0`), we set the `rowZero` flag to `True`.
- **Example:**  
  - In our example, since `r = 1` (not the first row), we set the first element of row 1 to 0:
    ```
    Before marking row:
    Row 1: [1, 0, 1] → becomes → [0, 0, 1]
    ```
- **Why we do it:**  
  The first column of each row acts as a marker. Later, when we see a 0 in the first column of a row, we know that row must be set to zeros.
  For the first row, since we are using it to mark columns, we use the `rowZero` flag to remember if the first row should be zeroed instead of overwriting it with markers.

---

### **2.6 Updating the Matrix Based on the Markers**

Now that we've gone through the entire matrix and marked which rows and columns should become zero, we need to update the rest of the matrix.

```python
for r in range(1, ROWS):
    for c in range(1, COLS):
        if matrix[r][0] == 0 or matrix[0][c] == 0:
            matrix[r][c] = 0  # Set the cell to zero
```
- **What it does:**  
  - We start from row 1 and column 1 (skipping the first row and first column because they’re used as markers).
  - For each cell, we check if its row or column was marked (i.e., if either the first element of its row or the first element of its column is 0).
  - If yes, we set that cell to 0.
- **Example:**  
  In our example, for cell (2, 1):
  - Check `matrix[2][0]`: if it is 0, the whole row must be 0.  
    Or check `matrix[0][1]`: if it is 0, the whole column must be 0.
  - Since column 1 was marked (matrix[0][1] is 0), we set cell (2, 1) to 0.
- **Why we do it:**  
  This step uses our “notes” (markers) to actually change the numbers in the grid. We are now using our stored information to update the grid.

---

### **2.7 Handling the First Column**

```python
if matrix[0][0] == 0:
    for r in range(ROWS):
        matrix[r][0] = 0
```
- **What it does:**  
  - We check the top-left cell (`matrix[0][0]`). If it is 0, it means that the first column needs to be set to zeros.
  - We loop through every row and set the first column (`matrix[r][0]`) to 0.
- **Why we do it:**  
  The top-left cell is a special place because it is part of both the first row and first column. If it’s 0, it means we have marked the first column for zeroing.
- **Example:**  
  If after the first pass `matrix[0][0]` is 0, then the first column becomes:
  ```
  [0,
   0,
   0]
  ```

---

### **2.8 Handling the First Row**

```python
if rowZero:
    for c in range(COLS):
        matrix[0][c] = 0
```
- **What it does:**  
  - If our `rowZero` flag is `True` (meaning we found a 0 in the first row earlier), we set every element in the first row to 0.
- **Why we do it:**  
  We cannot use the first row for markers and update it later because its original data was needed to mark columns. This flag lets us remember that it should also be turned into 0s.
- **Example:**  
  The first row will be changed from something like `[1, 0, 1]` to `[0, 0, 0]`.

## **3. Pseudo-Code Version**

Below is a version of the algorithm in pseudo-code (a simplified way to think about it without strict programming language syntax):

```
1. Set ROWS = number of rows in matrix
2. Set COLS = number of columns in matrix
3. Initialize rowZero as False

4. For each row r from 0 to ROWS-1:
     For each column c from 0 to COLS-1:
         If matrix[r][c] is 0 then:
             Set matrix[0][c] = 0   // Mark this column in the first row
             If r > 0 then:
                 Set matrix[r][0] = 0  // Mark this row in the first column
             Else:
                 Set rowZero = True   // Remember that first row should be zeroed

5. For each row r from 1 to ROWS-1:
     For each column c from 1 to COLS-1:
         If matrix[r][0] is 0 OR matrix[0][c] is 0 then:
             Set matrix[r][c] = 0

6. If matrix[0][0] is 0 then:
     For each row r from 0 to ROWS-1:
         Set matrix[r][0] = 0   // Zero out the first column

7. If rowZero is True then:
     For each column c from 0 to COLS-1:
         Set matrix[0][c] = 0   // Zero out the first row
```

## **4. Logical Thinking Tips for Coding**

1. **Understand the Problem Clearly:**  
   - Read the problem statement several times until you are sure what is required.
   - Break the problem into small steps. For our problem:  
     - Find zeros  
     - Mark rows and columns  
     - Update the matrix based on markers  

2. **Plan Before You Code:**  
   - Write down the steps in your own words (like our pseudo-code).  
   - Think about what information you need to remember (here, we needed to know which rows and columns have zeros).

3. **Use Examples:**  
   - Work through a simple example by hand (as we did with the 3x3 matrix).
   - Check what happens to each cell. This helps you see if your plan makes sense.

4. **Use In-Place Marking When Possible:**  
   - Instead of using extra space (like additional arrays), try to use the data structure itself to store information.  
   - In our solution, we used the first row and first column to remember which rows/columns should be zeroed.

5. **Write Clear, Step-by-Step Code:**  
   - Comment your code as you write it.  
   - Explain why each part is necessary (as shown above).

6. **Test with Different Cases:**  
   - Think about edge cases (e.g., what if the first row already has a zero? What if the matrix has only one row or one column?).

---

## **5. Final Recap**

- **Step 1:** We determine the size of the matrix.  
- **Step 2:** We initialize a flag (`rowZero`) to check if the first row needs to be zeroed.  
- **Step 3:** We scan every cell in the matrix.  
  - When we find a zero, we mark the corresponding column (in the first row) and row (in the first column).  
  - Special care is taken if the zero is in the first row.
- **Step 4:** We update the matrix using these markers—any cell whose row or column is marked becomes 0.
- **Step 5:** Finally, we handle the first column and the first row based on the markers and flag.

By following this logical sequence, you can solve the problem efficiently without needing extra space. This way of thinking—breaking down the problem into manageable parts, planning your approach with pseudo-code, and testing with examples—is a great method for coding any solution.
